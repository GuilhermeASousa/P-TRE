 A recommendation system for time formation in programming competitions

This project aims to create a system capable of making recommendations for training teams for programming competitions. The teams' formation is based on the model adopted in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC). The data used in the project are from the Codeforces site, one of the sites most widely used by ACM-ICPC contestants.
